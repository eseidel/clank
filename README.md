An attempt a simulating the rules of one of my wife's favorite games: Clank!
https://www.direwolfdigital.com/clank/


## Getting Started

```
dart run bin/simulate.dart
```

## Missing Features
* Crystal Cave exhaustion
* Many Cards
* Market
* Various card effects (trashing, teleport, etc.)
* Missing "deep" half of map.
* Spending health for swords to move.

## Issues
* Most games end w/o escape since random planning just walks around.
